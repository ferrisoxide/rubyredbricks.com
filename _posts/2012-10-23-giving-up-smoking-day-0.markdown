**Reasons for Quitting**

**For myself**. I'm a slow dive. Smoking and stressing and not sleeping all feed into themselves. There's at least one thing I can yank out of the cycle.

**For my family**. Only thing worse than having a dad who stinks of cancer breath - is not having him around at all. I'm in this for the long haul. Love my kids. Love my wife. Love my friends and family.

**For the hip pocket**. Man smoking is expensive. I could have bought a [really nice guitar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Jaguar) for what I've spent on smokes. Or one heck of a lot of Lego.

**Because enough is enough**. I've tried all sorts of ways to give up. Kidded myself enough times that 'this is the last packet because...'. Time's up.



**To be a better corporate citizen**. Apart from the regular anti-social "thinking time" outside, nothing says "lack of respect" like stinking up the office.

**Because it's lost its cachet**. I took up smoking to give up. 10 years without smoking I started again so I could experience going through withdrawals. A bit odd perhaps. But it's given me things to write about. So write..

**Reasons for Quitting**: more than a badly framed nerd joke.
